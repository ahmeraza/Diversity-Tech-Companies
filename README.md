# Diversity-Tech-Companies
This analysis investigates diversity within leading tech companies in Silicon Valley using demographic data.

## Description

This analysis investigates diversity within leading tech companies using demographic data from 2014 to 2018. 
By examining gender and ethnic representation across 23 companies, the goal is to identify trends, disparities, 
and potential areas for improvement. The analysis uses Python to explore the proportion of different demographic 
groups, assess progress over time, and highlight gaps in representation. Insights derived from this data will 
inform recommendations for fostering a more inclusive and equitable workplace culture in the tech industry.

Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DEIB) are critical factors in assessing workplace culture and 
corporate responsibility. It is a cornerstone of the Social pillar in Environmental, Social, and Governance 
(ESG) frameworks. It promotes fair treatment, reduces systemic inequalities, and fosters inclusive workplaces, 
enhancing innovation, productivity, and employee satisfaction. Organizations prioritizing DEIB build trust 
with stakeholders, improve their reputation, and mitigate risks like discrimination lawsuits. Diverse teams 
drive innovation and economic growth, while fostering belonging strengthens social cohesion and community 
resilience.
